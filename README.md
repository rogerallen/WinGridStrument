# WinGridStrument

A MIDI instrument inspired by the [LinnStrument](http://www.rogerlinndesign.com/linnstrument.html) and 
[Madrona Labs SoundPlane](http://madronalabs.com/soundplane).

WinGridStrument is a Windows (win32) reimplementation of my [Gridstrument](https://github.com/rogerallen/GridStrument) 
and **requires a touchscreen** to work.  Developed on a Surface Pro 7.

## Status

Work-in-progress.  Barely works.

## Usage

1. Start [loopMIDI](http://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) 
2. Connect your MIDI software synthesizer to listen to the LoopMIDI port.
3. Start app. [FIXME! May need to edit source to connect with LoopMIDI]
4. Enjoy!
